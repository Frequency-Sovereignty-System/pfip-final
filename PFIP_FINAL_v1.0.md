## Verification

- PFIP_FINAL_sha256.txt

The SHA256 file records checksums for the preserved PDF asset filenames and may be used for integrity verification and provenance continuity.

---

## Version identity

Package version: PFIP FINAL v1.0

This repository may contain multiple commits over time (e.g., metadata improvements),
but the canonical snapshot for citation and verification should be treated as a tagged Release object.

Recommended release tag naming:
- v1.0

---

## Optional content addressing (CID)

If an IPFS CID is provided for this package in the future,
it should be recorded in the Root system index or provenance records
to support content-addressed persistence alongside SHA256 verification.

---

## Use / interpretation boundary (non-binding)

This material is descriptive and non-binding.

It should not be interpreted as legal, technical, medical, financial, clinical, or other professional advice,
and should not be treated as an instruction set for implementation, enforcement, compliance mandates,
or automated decision-making.

Any terms that resemble governance, protocol, authority, verification, control, restriction, or immunity
are used descriptively to communicate a publication and boundary pattern,
not to assert coercive power or impose duties on any person or organization.

## Reference guidance 

For public reference, discussion, or citation, please cite the canonical root entry:
- tux133144.eth

When a URL is required, cite the Root repository Releases page (recommended canonical citation target).

This repository should be referenced as a supporting asset package, not as the sole authoritative entry point.
